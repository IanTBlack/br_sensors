# br_sensors
A set of Python 3 modules for accessing Blue Robotics sensors.


## examples
This folder contains examples for driving each sensor or combination of sensors.
In order for them to work properly, you'll need to add each module to your Python path.
Alternatively, you could copy each class into your operating script.
